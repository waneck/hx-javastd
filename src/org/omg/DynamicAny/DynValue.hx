/**
* DynValue objects support the manipulation of IDL non-boxed value types.
* The DynValue interface can represent both null and non-null value types.
* For a DynValue representing a non-null value type, the DynValue's components comprise
* the public and private members of the value type, including those inherited from concrete base value types,
* in the order of definition. A DynValue representing a null value type has no components
* and a current position of -1.
* <P>Warning: Indiscriminantly changing the contents of private value type members can cause the value type
* implementation to break by violating internal constraints. Access to private members is provided to support
* such activities as ORB bridging and debugging and should not be used to arbitrarily violate
* the encapsulation of the value type.
