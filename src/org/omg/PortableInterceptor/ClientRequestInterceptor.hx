/**
* Client-side request interceptor.
* <p>
* A request Interceptor is designed to intercept the flow of a 
* request/reply sequence through the ORB at specific points so that 
* services can query the request information and manipulate the service 
* contexts which are propagated between clients and servers. The primary 
* use of request Interceptors is to enable ORB services to transfer 
* context information between clients and servers. There are two types 
* of request Interceptors: client-side and server-side. 
* <p>
* To write a client-side Interceptor, implement the 
* <code>ClientRequestInterceptor</code> interface. 
*
* @see ClientRequestInfo
