/**
* Portable Interceptors Current (also known as <code>PICurrent</code>) 
* is merely a slot table, the slots of which are used by each service to 
* transfer their context data between their context and the request's or 
* reply's service context. Each service which wishes to use PICurrent 
* reserves a slot or slots at initialization time and uses those slots 
* during the processing of requests and replies.
* <p>
* Before an invocation is made, PICurrent is obtained via a call to 
* <code>ORB.resolve_initial_references( "PICurrent" )</code>. From within 
* the interception points, the data on PICurrent that has moved from the 
* thread scope to the request scope is available via the 
* <code>get_slot</code> operation on the <code>RequestInfo</code> object. 
* A PICurrent can still be obtained via 
* <code>resolve_initial_references</code>, but that is the Interceptor's 
* thread scope PICurrent.
