//// This class is a copy of the com.sun.scn.servicetags.SolarisSystemEnvironment
//// class from the Sun Connection source.
////
//// The Service Tags team maintains the latest version of the implementation
//// for system environment data collection.  JDK will include a copy of
//// the most recent released version for a JDK release. We rename
//// the package to com.sun.servicetag so that the Sun Connection
//// product always uses the latest version from the com.sun.scn.servicetags
//// package. JDK and users of the com.sun.servicetag API
//// (e.g. NetBeans and SunStudio) will use the version in JDK.
////
//// So we keep this class in src/share/classes instead of src/<os>/classes.
